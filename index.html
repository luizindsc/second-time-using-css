<p class="main">It's funny Zelda is my favorite game, since it's one of my least played <br>
games. The reason it's my favorite game is the story and the songs, the songs <br>
alone give me an inexplicable feeling. By far my favorite and most played game <br>
in the Zelda series is Ocarina Of Time Thank you for existing!</p>

<h4>Honorable Mention</h4>
<img src="images/zelda-botw.png" alt="Zelda BOTW print">
<p>      Zelda BOTW is the best game in the franchise <br>
         for those who have never played it, I played <br>
         very little since emulators are shit on my pc
